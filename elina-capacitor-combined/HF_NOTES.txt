Hugging Face usage

- This project uses Hugging Face Inference public endpoints by default.
- Public endpoints have rate limits. For more capacity, create an HF account and generate an access token:
  https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
- Simple method to provide token during development:
  - Open web console and run: window.HF_TOKEN = 'hf_xxx';
  - Or add native secure storage and set HF_TOKEN at app runtime.
